# Animal Crossing Music

## About
Just a fun Chrome extension for playing Animal Crossing's music in the background while you work or play or do whatever it is you do with your browser. Updates in real-time whenever a new hour rolls around, and informs you via an optional desktop notification. Supports both soundtracks from Animal Forrest (N64)/Animal Crossing (GCN) and Wild World (DS)/City Folk (Wii), *however,* you must supply your own music and name it appropriately. I'm glad to open source and distribute this extension, but I feel uneasy about offering music files straight up for download, let alone in a project I'm permitting others to use.
